feat(ml): upgrade to quantized ONNX FinancialBERT

- **Core**: Replaced legacy TextBlob sentiment engine with a high-performance FinancialBERT model.
- **Optimization**: Applied dynamic Int8 quantization via ONNX Runtime to minimize memory footprint (<100MB) and CPU usage suitable for low-resource VPS.
- **Workflow**: Added build_model.py for local quantization and updated Dockerfile to utilize pre-built model artifacts.
- **Infra**: Configured strict model loading to ensure zero silent failures in production.
- **Deps**: Added `optimum` and `transformers` to backend dependencies.
