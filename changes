feat: optimize RAM usage, improve data resolution, and fix mobile layout

- Optimized RAM usage (~1GB reduction) by implementing lazy ML model loading and isolating heavy imports to the Celery worker process.
- Refactored backend to a "DB-first" model, where the FastAPI process serves historical snapshots directly from SQLite instead of performing live analysis.
- Updated database schema to store detailed sentiment counts (bull/bear/neutral) for optimized dashboard reconstruction.
- Increased data collection resolution from hourly to 15-minute intervals.
- Fixed data collection logic to ensure only scheduled Celery tasks save to the database, preventing "mid-hour" timestamps from manual refreshes.
- Updated frontend chart to support high-density data with horizontal scrolling and a persistent Y-axis.
- Implemented responsive design fixes, including a stacking grid and adaptive charts for a premium mobile experience.
- Refactored `SentimentAnalyzer` for lazy initialization of the ONNX model.
