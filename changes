feat: optimize memory, add auto-cleanup and refine UI

- **Infra**: Optimized Celery worker memory usage by enforcing single concurrency and process restarts after every task (`--max-tasks-per-child=1`), resolving potential memory leaks.
- **Backend**: Implemented daily database auto-cleanup task (retention policy of 7 days) to prevent disk space exhaustion.
